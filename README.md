# AudioWatermarkEvaluationToolkit
A MATLAB application for the assessment of watermarking techniques.

Audio Watermark Evaluation Toolkit is a MATLAB-based application that allows developers to process embedded audio signals with attacks, specifically designed to disrupt the extraction of the watermark. Careful consideration has been placed on the attacks available within the application based on their use as testing methods for existing watermarking techniques.

The processes within the application have been tested thoroughly to ensure their effectiveness in evaluating watermarking schemes in development. This application can be launched from within MATLAB, allowing users to process audio and write it to any relevant directory.
